  <h3>Course Description</h3>
  <p>
    The aim of this course is to study the latest research and development in analyzing
    the security and privacy of emerging networks and technologies. We will study different
    traditional and AI-based security analysis techniques. For traditional techniques, we
    will study fuzzing, formal verification, model checking, and static and dynamic analysis
    techniques. For AI-based techniques, we will focus on different agentic AI techniques
    from both academic research and industry (see Aardvark from OpenAI:
    <a href="https://openai.com/index/introducing-aardvark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
      https://openai.com/index/introducing-aardvark/
    </a>).
    The course aims to lay the foundation for complex network and system analysis, such as
    5G and NextG networks, Satellite Communication, and emerging IoT protocols like Matter.
  </p>

  <h3>Course Objectives</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to understand the details of vulnerabilities in networks and systems.</li>
    <li>Ability to understand the foundations of applying formal verification for complex systems.</li>
    <li>Ability to understand and apply static and dynamic security testing tools for systems.</li>
    <li>Ability to understand and present top-tier security conference papers.</li>
    <li>Ability to conduct hands-on security research and write research papers.</li>
    <li>Ability to understand and evaluate the application of various security techniques on 5G and NextG networks.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Course Books and Materials</h3>
  <p>
    There are no course books specific to the class. Most of the materials are research papers,
    which will be provided by the instructor.

  <h3>Grading</h3>
  <p>
    There are no exams or quizzes in this course! The course will be graded based on
    the research project, paper presentation, paper reviews, and class participation
    in the following proportions:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>50%</strong> Research project (including formal presentation and paper write-up)</li>
    <li><strong>30%</strong> Paper presentations</li>
    <li><strong>10%</strong> Paper reviews</li>
    <li><strong>10%</strong> Class participation</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Grades will be curved.
    A: &ge; 90,
    B: &ge; 80 and &lt; 90,
    C: &ge; 70 and &lt; 80,
    D: &ge; 60 and &lt; 70,
    F: &lt; 60.
  </p>

  <h3>Research Project</h3>
  <p>
    The big deliverable from this course is the course project. The expectation is a
    paper prepared for submission to a top security conference. A student can port
    their existing lab research for this course, provided that:
  </p>
  <ol>
    <li>It is related to network and system security;</li>
    <li>The student is the lead author;</li>
    <li>Within the timeframe of the course, substantial research can be done.</li>
  </ol>
  <p>
    The instructor and student will have a discussion to decide ultimately.
  </p>

  <h3>Presentation and Participation</h3>
  <p>
    The student will present 3–4 papers throughout the course. In each presentation,
    students who are not presenters will try to ask questions and find a gap in the
    paper, whereas the presenters have to defend the paper. This is where the
    participation points will come from. If you do not participate, there are no points.
  </p>

  <h3>Paper Reviews</h3>
  <p>
    Each week, students will write a review (maximum two pages) for one of the papers
    assigned that week. A specific review format will be provided. Papers from the
    following conferences will be used:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>IEEE S&amp;P</li>
    <li>CCS</li>
    <li>NDSS</li>
    <li>USENIX Security</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>GenAI Usage Policy</h3>
  <p>
    You are welcome to use ChatGPT, Claude, DeepSeek, Gemini, or any other tools. It is
    good to understand and know how to use these tools, and it’s not fair for the
    instructor to stop any student from using them. However, these tools should be
    used to understand concepts after going through the contents of the class and in
    no way as a reference or an alternative to the class, course book, or slides.
  </p>
  <p>
    These tools hallucinate frequently, especially for technical networking content.
    They may sound confident but be incorrect. Similarly, they may be used to review
    papers, but such reviews are often poor and easily detectable. If you submit bad
    reviews, you will receive zero points.
  </p>

  <h3>Student Conduct &amp; Discipline</h3>
  <p>
    The University of Texas System and The University of Texas at Dallas have rules and
    regulations for the orderly and efficient conduct of their business. It is the
    responsibility of each student and student organization to be knowledgeable about
    the rules governing student conduct and activities.
  </p>
  <p>
    Student discipline is administered under recognized due process as defined in the
    Rules and Regulations of the Board of Regents, The University of Texas System, and
    the university’s Handbook of Operating Procedures. Copies of these rules are
    available in the Office of the Dean of Students (SU 1.602, 972-883-6391).
  </p>
  <p>
    Students are expected to obey federal, state, and local laws as well as Regents’
    Rules and university regulations. Violations may result in disciplinary action,
    whether on or off campus.
  </p>

  <h3>Academic Integrity</h3>
  <p>
    Students are expected to maintain a high level of academic honesty. Scholastic
    dishonesty includes, but is not limited to, cheating, plagiarism, collusion, and
    falsifying academic records. Students suspected of academic dishonesty are subject
    to disciplinary proceedings.
  </p>
  <p>
    Plagiarism, including plagiarism from the web or from work submitted for other
    classes, is unacceptable and will be handled under university policy. This course
    will use Turnitin.com, which searches the web for possible plagiarism.
  </p>

  <h3>Email Use</h3>
  <p>
    Official communication between faculty, staff, and students must use U.T. Dallas
    email accounts. The university provides each student with a free email account for
    official correspondence, which may be forwarded to other accounts if desired.
  </p>

  <h3>Withdrawal from Class</h3>
  <p>
    Deadlines for withdrawal are published in the semester’s course catalog. It is the
    student’s responsibility to follow all administrative procedures. Instructors
    cannot drop or withdraw students from classes.
  </p>

  <h3>Student Grievance Procedures</h3>
  <p>
    Procedures for student grievances are described in the university’s Handbook of
    Operating Procedures. Students must first attempt to resolve grievances directly
    with the instructor. If unresolved, appeals may proceed through the School Dean
    and, ultimately, an Academic Appeals Panel, whose decision is final.
  </p>

  <h3>Incomplete Grades</h3>
  <p>
    Incomplete grades are granted only for work unavoidably missed at the end of the
    semester and only if at least 70% of the coursework has been completed. Incompletes
    must be resolved within eight weeks of the next long semester or they will convert
    to a grade of F.
  </p>

  <h3>Disability Services</h3>
  <p>
    Disability Services provides accommodations to ensure equal educational
    opportunities. The office is located in the Student Union, room 1.610, with
    extended weekday hours.
  </p>
  <address>
    <strong>Office of Disability Services</strong><br>
    The University of Texas at Dallas, SU 22<br>
    PO Box 830688<br>
    Richardson, TX 75083-0688<br>
    Phone: (972) 883-2098
  </address>
  <p>
    Students requiring accommodations must notify their professors and provide
    documentation from Disability Services.
  </p>

  <h3>Religious Holy Days</h3>
  <p>
    Students will be excused for the observance of religious holy days in accordance
    with Texas law. Students should notify instructors as early as possible and will
    be allowed a reasonable time to complete missed work.
  </p>

  <h3>Off-Campus Instruction and Course Activities</h3>
  <p>
    Off-campus and out-of-state activities are subject to state law and university
    travel and risk policies. Additional information is available through the Office
    of the School Dean and the university travel risk website.
