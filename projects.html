  <h2>Project</h2>
  <p>
    In this semester-long project, students will conduct research on network or systems
    security in teams of 1–2 people under the instructor's supervision. All teams and
    project topics must be approved by the instructor. The outcome of this project will
    be similar to a conference-style paper of at most 10 pages, in which you build an
    argument for studying the open research problems you advocate investigating—identifying
    why the problem is important and why it is solvable in the near future. The grade will
    be based on novelty, depth, correctness, rigor of execution, clarity of presentation,
    and effort.
  </p>

  <h3>Project Theme</h3>
  <p>
    “Thinking like an adversary” is critical to understanding (1) the current security and
    privacy posture of a system, (2) how existing security policies can be broken, and
    (3) how to enforce stronger and more robust security policies. Accordingly, each
    project should align with the theme of <strong>security analysis of an existing system</strong>.
  </p>
  <p>
    The overarching goal is to design and implement a systematic security evaluation
    framework using program analysis, software testing, formal verification, and applied
    cryptography. Each project consists of two parts, each with multiple milestones.
  </p>

  <h4>Part 1 – Reproducing an Existing Attack</h4>
  <p>
    As the first step, you will reproduce a known attack on an existing system. Your task
    is to understand a known vulnerability and its corresponding attack and write an
    original exploit. You may not contact the paper authors for exploits or use
    pre-packaged attack tools. However, you may use open-source, general-purpose tools
    (e.g., gdb, Wireshark, packet sniffers) and scripts.
  </p>
  <p>
    Some vulnerabilities may have been fixed in newer software or libraries (e.g., Linux,
    TCP, TLS), so you may need to target older versions.
  </p>
  <p>
    According to the course ethics policy, you must not test attacks against systems owned
    by others. All attacks must be conducted against your own isolated device, machine,
    or virtual machine.
  </p>
  <p>
    You will present a demo showing (1) the vulnerability, (2) how it can be exploited,
    and (3) the implications of the attack. You will also explain how you implemented the
    exploit, set up the attack environment, and the technical challenges encountered.
  </p>

  <h4>Part 2 – Project Extensions</h4>
  <p>
    Based on insights gained from Part 1, you may extend your project in one or more of
    the following directions:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Identify a new attack on the same system or protocol.</li>
    <li>Design a systematic security analysis framework using formal verification, static or dynamic analysis, fuzzing, or other testing techniques.</li>
    <li>Propose verified or high-assurance defenses.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Project Topics</h2>
  <p>
    Students are encouraged to consult recent proceedings from top security venues,
    including IEEE Security &amp; Privacy (Oakland), ACM CCS, NDSS, and USENIX Security.
    Relevant work can also be found at Black Hat and DEF CON.

    Design Details, Implementation, Evaluation, Discussion and Limitations, Related Work,
    and Conclusion and Future Work.
  </p>

<section>
  <h3>Abstract</h3>
  <p>
    An abstract should be relatively short: one paragraph, around 300 words. A wandering
    and off-topic abstract can confuse the reader. Consider the following template for
    writing an abstract (approximately one sentence per point):
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Area</li>
    <li>Problem</li>
    <li>Solution Idea</li>
    <li>Methodology</li>
    <li>Results</li>
    <li>Take-away</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Introduction</h3>
  <p>
    The abstract and introduction are two important sections of your paper. An introduction
    is a longer version of the same outline as the abstract, often dedicating about a
    paragraph per point. This section motivates the research problem, clearly states the
    problem, explains why existing solutions are insufficient, presents the proposed ideas,
    provides high-level intuitions for why the approach should work, and summarizes the
    high-level results.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you fail to capture the reviewer’s interest in the abstract and introduction, it is
    difficult to recover. These sections are also the most-read parts of a published paper.
  </p>

  <h3>Background</h3>
  <p>
    Provide only the background knowledge necessary to understand your paper. Do not include
    details that are never used or referenced. For example, in a paper on X.509 certificate
    validation, it is unnecessary to explain how public and private keys are generated or
    their key lengths.
  </p>

  <h3>Design Overview</h3>
  <p>
    Discuss the security assumptions, adversary capabilities and goals, and the trusted
    computing base. Summarize the design challenges of your proposed solution and provide
    high-level intuitions for addressing them. Finally, present a high-level overview of
    your system or solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may use diagrams to illustrate the proposal. Without delving into detailed
    implementations, describe the functionality of each major component and the interactions
    among them using appropriate figures.
  </p>

  <h3>Design Details</h3>
  <p>
    Describe all components of your proposed system in detail and explain how critical
    corner cases are handled. These corner cases are important for enabling experts to
    fully understand your design and for allowing others to replicate or extend your work.
  </p>
  <p>
    Always explain the intuition behind your design decisions—why you made certain choices
    is more important than how they were implemented. Keep the discussion at a conceptual
    level rather than focusing on low-level implementation details.
  </p>

  <h3>Implementation Details</h3>
  <p>
    Describe the software and hardware used, written, or modified in your implementation.
    Explain what each module does, how it relates to the system components, and how it
    supports the overall solution.
  </p>

  <h3>Evaluation</h3>
  <h4>Evaluation Setup</h4>
  <p>
    Describe how experiments were set up, including evaluation metrics, datasets used (if
    any), and baseline results for comparison. Ensure that the metrics directly address
    the research questions.
  </p>

  <h4>Evaluation Results</h4>
  <p>
    Present results using tables and graphs. If different experiments use different setups,
    clearly describe the hardware, software, and datasets used. For informal security
    analysis, justify how the proposed solution prevents the attacks described in the
    threat model.
  </p>

  <h3>Related Work</h3>
  <p>
    Conduct a thorough investigation of related work. A good related work section is not a
    simple list of papers; instead, it tells a story of how prior research has evolved to
    address related problems. Clearly contrast your work with prior approaches rather than
    merely summarizing them.
  </p>
  <p>
    Even if your research is ongoing, you should have enough understanding to compare your
    ideas with existing work. Pay attention to how related work sections are written in
    high-quality papers and identify what makes them effective or ineffective.
  </p>

  <h3>Conclusion and Future Work</h3>
  <p>
    Do not summarize the paper in this section. Instead, reflect on the broader implications
    of your work and discuss future research directions and possibilities that arise from
    your findings.
